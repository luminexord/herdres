# Herdres

This branch is a tiny source-mode-only Telegram connector for Tendwire.

Herdres does not observe or control Herdr directly here. Tendwire owns Herdr
observation, worker bindings, turns, pending interactions, command routing,
receipts, backend health, and connector outbox. Herdres owns Telegram polling,
topics, message send/edit, compact working updates, final response display, and
Telegram delivery dedup.

## Runtime

```text
Telegram topic input
  -> herdres-gateway
  -> herdres command
  -> tendwire command --json

herdres sync
  -> tendwire snapshot/turns/pending/connector
  -> Telegram topics/messages/pinned status
```

Only `HERDRES_TENDWIRE_MODE=source` is supported.

By default Herdres creates one Telegram topic per Tendwire space:

```sh
HERDRES_SOURCE_TOPIC_MODE=space
```

Use worker/pane topics only when explicitly wanted:

```sh
HERDRES_SOURCE_TOPIC_MODE=worker
```

Finished council/gitmoot/gm worker topics are deleted automatically when
`HERDRES_DELETE_DONE_COUNCIL_TOPICS=1`.

Rich Telegram messages are enabled by default. Final responses render as open
rich content; working updates render as compact editable updates.

Optional per-agent bot identities are configured with generic private tokens:

```sh
HERDR_TELEGRAM_TOPICS_MANAGED_BOTS=1
HERDRES_MANAGED_BOT_CODEX_TOKEN=...
HERDRES_MANAGED_BOT_CLAUDE_TOKEN=...
```

When enabled, Herdres polls configured child bots as well as the manager bot.
Use `/voice per_agent` or `/voice shared` inside a space topic to switch that
space. Unconfigured agent kinds fall back to the manager bot. Do not commit real
bot tokens or local bot names.

Telegram voice notes are separate from bot identity. Inbound audio transcription
is local and opt-in:

```sh
python3 -m venv ~/.local/share/herdres/speech-venv
uv pip install --python ~/.local/share/herdres/speech-venv/bin/python sherpa-onnx numpy
~/.local/share/herdres/speech-venv/bin/python ~/.local/bin/herdres speech install
HERDR_TELEGRAM_TOPICS_SPEECH_INPUT=1
```

The gateway downloads a voice note with the bot token that received it, deletes
the temporary audio after transcription, and sends only the transcript through
Tendwire.

## Install

```sh
./install-user.sh
$EDITOR ~/.config/herdres/herdres.env
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable --now herdres.service herdres-gateway.service
```

Do not run the legacy `herdr-telegram-topics.timer` with this branch.

### Services

This branch runs two user services (plus the Tendwire daemon):

- `herdres.service` — the source sync loop (`herdres sync --loop`). It reads
  Tendwire snapshots/turns/pending and drives Telegram topics, messages, and
  pinned status. This replaces the old `herdres.timer`; there is no timer unit
  on this branch.
- `herdres-gateway.service` — inbound Telegram polling; forwards topic input to
  `herdres command` → `tendwire command`.
- `tendwired.service` — the Tendwire daemon (installed from the Tendwire repo);
  Herdres depends on it but does not manage it.

## Send transport

Herdres submits every outbound instruction through Tendwire's public command
path (`command.submit`, invoked as `tendwire command --json`). Herdres never
sees or handles `pane_id`, `terminal_id`, or `send_keys` — those never appear in
public or source-mode state. Tendwire owns the private send target and may, for
delivery reliability, drive a private Herdr pane transport internally; that is a
Tendwire implementation detail behind the public command contract. Planned
follow-up: switch Tendwire's internal send to the semantic `agent.send` API once
it is stable, with no change to the public command path Herdres depends on.

## Rollback

This branch is source-only: `HERDRES_TENDWIRE_MODE` must be `source`
(`require_source_mode` rejects any other value — there is no
`HERDRES_TENDWIRE_MODE=off`). To roll back, switch the checkout to a legacy
(non-tendwired) Herdres branch or release tag and reinstall from there:

```sh
systemctl --user disable --now herdres.service herdres-gateway.service
git checkout <legacy-herdres-tag>
./install-user.sh   # or the legacy branch's installer
```

Rolling back is a code/branch switch, not an environment-variable toggle.

## Checks

```sh
HERDRES_TENDWIRE_MODE=source ./herdres.py doctor
HERDRES_TENDWIRE_MODE=source ./herdres.py tendwire source-smoke --with-outbox
```

`source-smoke` must report `direct_herdr_calls=0`.
